# Turtle-Crossing
Turtle Crossing is a Python game where players guide a turtle across a busy road using the turtle module. Features include moving cars with varying speeds, collision detection, and a scoreboard to track levels. Each successful crossing increases the difficulty. Great for understanding object-oriented programming and game logic with animations!
